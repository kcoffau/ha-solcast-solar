### Changes

v4.0.22
- this time weather sensor is gone.. and midnight UTC reset works
- (*)added a config for setting a hard limit for inverters with over sized solar arrays 
   *99.9999999% of users will not need to ever user and set this (0.00000001% is @CarrapiettM)

v4.0.21
- removed weather sensor as it keeps failing with errors

v4.0.20
- fixed the info error for `solcast_pv_forecast_forecast_today (<class 'custom_components.solcast_solar.sensor.SolcastSensor'>) is using state class 'measurement' which is impossible considering device class ('energy')`
- removed the midnight UTC fetch and replaced with set to zero to reduce the polling on Solcast system
⚠️ To help reduce impact on the Solcast backend, Solcast have asked that users set their automations for polling with a random min and sec timing.. if you are polling at say 10:00 set it to 10:04:10 for instance so that everyone is not polling the services at the same time

v4.0.19
- fix resetting api limit/usage not updating HA UI

v4.0.18
- fixed weather sensor value not persisting 
- reset the api limit and usage sensors at UTC midnight (reset usage)

v4.0.17
- updated Slovak translation thanks @misa1515
- added sensor for Solcast weather description

v4.0.16
- added @Zachoz idea of adding a setting to select which solcast estimate field value for the forecast calculations, either estimate, estimate10 or estimate90
    ESTIMATE - Default forecasts  
    ESTIMATE10 = Forecasts 10 - cloudier than expected scenario  
    ESTIMATE90 = Forecasts 90 - less cloudy than expected scenario  

v4.0.15
- added custom 'Next X hours' sensor. You select the number of hours to be calculated as the sensor
- added French translation thanks to @Dackara
- added some sensors to be included in HA statistics data

v4.0.14
- changed attrib values from rooftop sites so pins are not added to maps (HA auto adds item to the map if attributes contain lat/long values)
- added Urdu thanks to @yousaf465

v4.0.13
- added Slovak translation thanks to @misa1515
- extended polling connection timeout from 60s to 120s
- added some more debug output points for data checking
- new forecast data attribute `dataCorrect` returns True of False if the data is complete for that day.
- removed `0 of 48` debug message for the 7th day forecast because if the api is not polled at midnight then the data is not complete for the 7th day (limitation of the max records Solcast returns)

v4.0.12
- HA 2023.11 beta forces sensors not to be listed under `Configuration`. The rooftop sensors have been moved to `Diagnostic`

v4.0.11
- better handling when data is missing pieces for some sensors

v4.0.10
- fixes for changing API key once one has previously been set

v4.0.9
- new service to update forecast hourly dampening factors

v4.0.8
- added Polish translation thanks to @home409ca
- added new `Dampening` to the Solcast Integration configuration

v4.0.7
- better handling when Solcast site does not return API data correctly

v4.0.6
- fixed divide by zero errors if there is no returned data
- fixed renaining today forecast value. now includes current 30min block forecast in the calculation

v4.0.5
- PR #192 - updated German translation.. thanks @florie1706
- fixed `Remaining Today` forecast.. it now also uses the 30min interval data
- fixed `Download diagnostic` data throwing an error when clicked

v4.0.4
- finished off the service call `query_forecast_data` to query the forecast data. Returns a list of forecast data using a datetime range start - end
- and thats all.. unless HA makes breaking changes or there is a major bug in v4.0.4, this is the last update

v4.0.3
- updated German thanks to @florie1706 PR#179 and removed all other localisation files
- added new attribute `detailedHourly` to each daily forecast sensor listing hourly forecasts in kWh
- if there is data missing, sensors will still show something but a debug log will outpout that the sensor is missing data


v4.0.2
- sensor names **have** changed!! this is due to locali(s/z)ation strings of the integration
- decimal percision changed for forecast tomorrow from 0 to 2
- fixed 7th day forecast missing data that was being ignored
- added new sensor `Power Now`
- added new sensor `Power Next 30 Mins`
- added new sensor `Power Next Hour`
- added locali(s/z)ation for all objects in the integation.. thanks to @ViPeR5000 for getting me started on thinking about this (google translate used, if you find anything wrong PR and i can update the translations)

v4.0.1
- rebased from 3.0.55
- keeps the last 730 days (2 years) of forecast data
- some sensors have have had their device_class and native_unit_of_measurement updated to a correct type
- API polling count is read directly from Solcast and is no longer calcuated
- no more auto polling.. its now up to every one to create an automation to poll for data when you want. This is due to so many users now only have 10 api calls a day
- striped out saving UTC time changing and keeping solcast data as it is so timezone data can be changed when needed
- history items went missing due to the sensor renamed. no longer using the HA history and instead just dtoring the data in the solcast.json file
- removed update actuals service.. actuals data from solcast is no longer polled (it is used on the first install to get past data so the integration works and i dont get issue reports because solcast do not give full day data, only data from when you call)
- lots of the logging messages have been updated to be debug,info,warning or errors
- some sensors **COULD** possibly no longer have extra attribute values or attribute values may have been renamed or have changed to the data storaged within
- greater in depth diagnostic data to share when needed to help debug any issues
- some of @rany2 work has been now integrated

# Removed 3.1.x
- too many users could not handle the power of this release
- v4.x.x replaces 3.0.55 - 3.1.x with new changes

v3.0.47
- added attribute weekday name for sensor forecasts, today, tomorrow, D3..7
  can read the names via the template 
{{ state_attr('sensor.solcast_forecast_today', 'dayname') }}
{{ state_attr('sensor.solcast_forecast_today', 'dayname') }}
{{ state_attr('sensor.solcast_forecast_tomorrow', 'dayname') }}
{{ state_attr('sensor.solcast_forecast_D3', 'dayname') }}
{{ state_attr('sensor.solcast_forecast_D4', 'dayname') }}
{{ state_attr('sensor.solcast_forecast_D5', 'dayname') }}
{{ state_attr('sensor.solcast_forecast_D6', 'dayname') }}
{{ state_attr('sensor.solcast_forecast_D7', 'dayname') }}

- do not install :) just for testing

v3.0.42
- fixed using the service to update forecasts from calling twice

v3.0.41
- recoded logging. Re-worded. More debug vs info vs error logging.
- API usage counter was not recorded when reset to zero at UTC midnight
- added a new service where you can call to update the Solcast Actuals data for the forecasts
- added the version info to the intergation UI

v3.0.40
- someone left some unused code in 3.0.39 causing problems

v3.0.39
- removed version info

v3.0.38
- error with v3.0.37 fix for updating sensors

v3.0.37
- make sure the hourly sensors update when auto polling is disabled

v3.0.36
- includes all pre release items
- actual past accurate data is now set to only poll the API at midday and last hour of the day (so only twice a day)

v3.0.35 - PRE RELEASE
- extended the internet connection timeout to 60s

v3.0.34 - PRE RELEASE
- added service to clear old solcast.json file to have a clean start
- return empty energy graph data if there is an error generating info

v3.0.33
- added sensors for forecast days 3,4,5,6,7

v3.0.32
- refactored HA setup function call requirements
- refactored some other code with typos to spell words correctly.. no biggie

v3.0.30
- merged in some work by @696GrocuttT PR into this release
- fixed code to do with using up all allowed api counts
- this release will most likely stuff up the current API counter, but after the UTC counter reset all will be right in the world of api counting again

v3.0.29
- changed Peak Time Today/Tomorrow sensor from datetime to time
- changed back the unit for peak measurement to Wh as the sensor is telling the peak/max hours generated forecast for the hour
- added new configuration option for the integration to disable auto polling. Users can then setup their own automation to poll for data when they like (mostly due to the fact that Solcast have changed the API allowance for new accounts to just 10 per day)
- API counter sensor now shows total used instead of allowance remaining as some have 10 others 50. It will 'Exceeded API Allowance' if you have none left

v3.0.9
- **users upgrading from v3.0.5 or lover, need to delete the 'solcast.json' file in the HA>config directory to stop any errors**
- renamed sensors with the prefix "solcast_" to help naming sensors easier

- 'actual forecast' data is now only called once, the last api call at sunset. OR during integration install first run.
- forecast data is still called every hour between sunrise and sunset and once at midnight every day.
*Just delete the old API Counter sensor as its not used now*

v3.0.5 beta
- fixed 'this hour' amd 'next hour' sensor values.
- slow down the api polling if more than 1 rooftop to poll.
- fix first hour graph plot data.
- possibly RC1?? will see.
